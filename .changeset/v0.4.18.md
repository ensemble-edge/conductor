Add Wrangler-based static assets system with public/protected directory structure

- Add `assets/public/` for edge-cached public assets (CSS, images, favicon)
- Add `assets/protected/` for auth-gated assets (requires API auth)
- Add `PublicAssetsConfig` and `ProtectedAssetsConfig` types
- Add convenience route for `/favicon.ico` redirecting to `/assets/public/favicon.ico`
- Update wrangler.toml template with `[assets]` configuration and `run_worker_first = true`
- Update example templates (dashboard, login-page) with correct CSS paths
