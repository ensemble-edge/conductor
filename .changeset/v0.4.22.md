"@ensemble-edge/conductor": patch
---

- **Dev-friendly log format**: Logs now display in readable `[conductor:inf]` format during local development instead of JSON. Production deployments continue using structured JSON for Workers Logs indexing.
- Fix non-runtime triggers (build, cli, cron) causing "No handler found" warnings at startup
- Fix asset routing for favicon.ico and other static assets in 404 handler
