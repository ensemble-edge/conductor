Add Cloud module for managed platform integration

**Cloud Module (`/cloud` endpoint):**
- New `/cloud` route handler for Ensemble Cloud platform connectivity
- Health endpoint for worker status monitoring
- Structure endpoint exposing project agents/ensembles/triggers
- Executions endpoint for remote execution history access
- Logs endpoint for centralized log streaming
- Sync endpoint for configuration synchronization

**Cloud CLI Handlers:**
- `ensemble cloud init` - Initialize Cloud connection with API key setup
- `ensemble cloud status` - Display current Cloud sync status
- `ensemble cloud rotate` - Rotate Cloud API keys
- `ensemble cloud disable` - Disable Cloud integration

**Auto-Discovery Enhancements:**
- Improved project detection for Conductor projects
- Better wrangler.toml parsing for Cloud initialization

This patch implements the foundation for the Ensemble Cloud managed platform,
enabling workers to communicate with the central dashboard for monitoring,
execution history, and configuration management.
