Add Conductor Pulse - anonymous usage metrics

- New pulse module with fire-and-forget telemetry on Worker cold start
- ProjectId generated at `conductor init`, stored in conductor.config.ts
- Auto-generates ephemeral projectId for upgraded projects at runtime
- `conductor validate` checks for missing projectId
- Pulse notice shown during project initialization
- Opt-out via DO_NOT_TRACK=1, CONDUCTOR_PULSE=false, or config.cloud.pulse=false
