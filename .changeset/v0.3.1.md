Fix npm packaging to include template src/build/ vite plugins

The .npmignore was excluding all `src/` directories, which prevented the vite build plugins in `catalog/cloud/cloudflare/templates/src/build/` from being included in the published package. This caused `conductor init` to create projects that couldn't build due to missing vite plugin files.
