"@ensemble-edge/conductor": patch
---

- **Dev-friendly log format**: Logs now display in readable `[conductor:inf]` format during local development instead of JSON. Production deployments continue using structured JSON for Workers Logs indexing.
- Fix non-runtime triggers (build, cli, cron) causing "No handler found" warnings at startup
- Fix timezone `getCurrentHour()` returning 24 at midnight (now correctly returns 0)
- Enable scripts discovery by default (`DEFAULT_SCRIPTS_DISCOVERY.enabled: true`)
- Improve Pulse visibility: log at info level when pulse is sent
- Show Project ID during `conductor init`
- Add user-facing test templates (agent, ensemble, error-handling tests)
- Expand assets README with common use cases (robots.txt, PWA, OpenAPI, fonts, well-known files)
