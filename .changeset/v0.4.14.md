### Bug Fixes

- **Template: Zero-config local development** - The default `wrangler.toml` template now has the `[ai]` binding commented out, allowing fresh installs to run `pnpm run dev` immediately without requiring Cloudflare login or API token setup. This removes friction from the getting-started experience.

### How to Enable Workers AI

Users who need Workers AI can enable it by:
- Uncommenting the `[ai]` section in `wrangler.toml`
- Or running `ensemble configure` → AI Provider → Workers AI
