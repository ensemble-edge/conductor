## Bug Fixes

Fix trigger authentication for user-defined routes:

- **Critical**: Global API auth middleware now only applies to built-in `/api/v1/*` routes
- User-defined trigger routes (e.g., `/api/protected`) now correctly use their own auth config
- Previously, global middleware blocked trigger-specific auth from running, causing all authenticated trigger endpoints to return 401
