Fix template src/build/ vite plugins not being committed to git

The root .gitignore had `build/` which ignored ALL directories named build/ at any depth, including the template vite plugins at `catalog/cloud/cloudflare/templates/src/build/`. Changed to `/build/` to only ignore the root build directory, and committed the template vite plugin files.
