Fix inline code agents, HTTP input parameters, and build warnings

- **Inline Code Agents**: Ensembles can now define agents with inline `operation: code` and embedded code strings that execute correctly
- **HTTP Input Parameters**: HTTP triggers now provide structured access to `body`, `params`, `query`, `method`, `path`, and `headers` with backwards compatibility
- **Build Warnings**: Eliminated Node.js import warnings by using browser-optimized builds for liquidjs and handlebars, reducing bundle size by ~15%
- **Component Resolver**: Refactored to be Workers-compatible using KV storage instead of filesystem
