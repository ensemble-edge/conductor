Schema-aware output for think agents and improved developer experience

- Think agents now map AI responses to schema-defined field names (e.g., `output: { greeting: string }` makes response available as `${agent.output.greeting}`)
- AI metadata (model, provider, tokensUsed) now accessible via `_meta` namespace
- Better validation error messages with helpful hints for common mistakes
- Improved Workers AI setup documentation in templates
- Documented YAML hot-reload limitation with workaround
