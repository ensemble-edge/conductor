- **Fix static assets URL mapping**: Public assets in `assets/public/` are now correctly served at root URLs (e.g., `/favicon.ico`, `/styles/reset.css`) instead of `/assets/public/*` paths. This aligns with how Wrangler's `directory` setting works as a document root.
- **Remove hardcoded favicon redirect**: Removed the automatic `/favicon.ico` → `/assets/public/favicon.ico` redirect that was causing 404s with the corrected asset configuration.
- **Update wrangler.toml template**: Changed `directory = "./assets"` to `directory = "./assets/public"` and set `run_worker_first = false` for optimal static asset performance.
