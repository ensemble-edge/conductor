# **Ensemble Overview**

**Ensemble Edge** represents a new class of orchestration platform — one that brings performance, observability, and human collaboration together at the edge. It’s built for engineers who demand precision and for business analysts who need visibility. Ensemble allows distributed systems, AI models, and data workflows to operate as one — efficiently, transparently, and in perfect sync.

At its core, Ensemble Edge reimagines automation as a living composition. *Members* act like musicians, each performing a specific function — reasoning agents (LLMs), data access, API calls, or evaluation — all described declaratively in YAML. *Ensembles* define how these Members interact, forming reusable, Git-versioned workflows that execute directly at the edge via the *Conductor*. This pushdown execution model eliminates centralized bottlenecks that plague legacy orchestration platforms like n8n, Airflow, or Zapier, achieving unprecedented scalability, security, and performance.

**Ensemble Cloud** extends the open-source foundation into an accessible, collaborative environment for non-engineers. Business analysts, operators, and domain experts can visually configure, test, and run Ensembles and Members without writing code. The Cloud UI, built on React Flow, enables intuitive editing, versioning, and tagging of prompts, queries, and code. Every change is saved or committed back to Git, preserving full transparency. Tags can be linked to environments — allowing for easy A/B testing, staged rollouts, and seamless movement from development to production.

Our strategy blends openness and performance. The core components — Conductor, CLI, SDK, and Templates — are open source and Git-native, giving developers total control. The managed **Ensemble Cloud** adds collaboration, observability, and version control at scale — not as a walled garden, but as a shared stage where technical and non-technical users can orchestrate complex systems together. It bridges the gap between human creativity and edge-native automation.

Our vision is to place engineers and extreme performance at the heart of automation. Ensemble Edge transforms how enterprises think about orchestration by delivering distributed intelligence at the edge — no servers to maintain, no pipelines to clog, no limits to scale. The result is a new era of workflow automation: one where every component, from LLMs to APIs, performs in harmony — fast, verifiable, and infinitely composable.
