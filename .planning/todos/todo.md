- narrow most console logging to debug state (what is that?)
- add .github/workflows to test and prepare conductor releases (like edgit)
- add baseline testin info in conductor init to seed new projets w testing, incl an example in hello-world member.
Includde a template claude.md in the init installation that tells it how to use edgit and conductor
Need to add a .github folder to the conductor install template that sets up github actions that help the customer / dev push their multiverse to their cloudldflare account/workers. << this will require a bit of thinking.
