# 🚨 CRITICAL: RELEASE WORKFLOW - READ THIS FIRST 🚨

## Standard Changesets Workflow (Official)

This project uses the official `changesets/action` for automated releases.

## 🤖 CLAUDE CODE: Release Workflow (MANDATORY STEPS)

**When user asks to create a release, ALWAYS follow this exact sequence:**

### Step 1: Sync with Remote (CRITICAL)
```bash
git pull origin master
```
**Why**: Prevents merge conflicts and ensures you're working on latest version

### Step 2: Check Current Version
```bash
grep '"version"' package.json
```
**Output the current version to user**

### Step 3: Ask User for Version Bump
**ALWAYS ASK - NEVER ASSUME**

Show user this table and ask which bump type:
```
Current version: X.Y.Z

Bump Options:
- patch (X.Y.Z+1) - Bug fixes only, no new features
- minor (X.Y+1.0) - New features, backwards compatible
- major (X+1.0.0) - Breaking changes

What type of bump do you want?
```

**Wait for user response. Do not proceed without confirmation.**

### Step 4: Create Changeset
Only after user confirms, create changeset file manually:

```bash
# Create .changeset/descriptive-name.md
```

**Format:**
```markdown
---
"@ensemble-edge/conductor": patch|minor|major
---

Brief description of changes
```

### Step 5: Commit Changeset
```bash
git add .changeset/
git commit -m "chore: add changeset for X"
```

### Step 6: Push to Remote
```bash
git push origin master
```

### Step 7: Inform User
Tell user:
- ✅ Changeset pushed
- ✅ GitHub Actions will create "Version Packages" PR
- ✅ Merge that PR when ready to publish to npm

## 🚨 Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem: "Remote has diverged" or "fetch first"
**Solution:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git log --oneline origin/master -5  # See what changed
git merge origin/master  # Merge remote changes
# Then continue with release
```

### Problem: Merge conflict in package.json
**Cause:** Working on old version while remote moved forward

**Solution:**
```bash
# Accept remote version
git checkout --theirs package.json
git add package.json
git commit -m "chore: resolve version conflict"
# Then create changeset on TOP of new version
```

### Problem: User says "version X.Y.Z" but semver doesn't match change type
**Solution:** ASK USER to confirm:
```
⚠️ Semver Check:
- You requested: X.Y.Z (patch)
- Changes include: New features (should be minor)

Do you still want patch, or should I use minor?
```

## Benefits
✅ **Industry standard** - Official Changesets workflow
✅ **Zero conflicts** - PR-based coordination (if you pull first!)
✅ **Full control** - You decide when to release (by merging PR)
✅ **Batched releases** - Multiple changes in one release
✅ **Automatic cleanup** - Changesets deleted on merge

## Never Do These:
- ❌ **DO NOT manually edit package.json or CHANGELOG.md**
- ❌ **DO NOT manually create or delete tags**
- ❌ **DO NOT merge Version Packages PR if tests are failing**
- ❌ **DO NOT create changeset without git pull first**
- ❌ **DO NOT assume version bump type - ALWAYS ask user**

## ⚠️ Important: Local Planning Directory

**When creating planning documents, phase summaries, TODO lists, or any working notes, ALWAYS place them in the `.planning/` directory.**

The `.planning/` directory is organized into three areas:

### `.planning/strategy/` - Strategic Planning
Long-term planning and project direction:
- Phase summaries: `PHASE0_SUMMARY.md`, `PHASE1_SUMMARY.md`, etc.
- Project checkpoints: `CHECKPOINT.md`
- Roadmaps and vision documents

### `.planning/todos/` - Task Management
Day-to-day tactical tasks:
- Current work items: `current-tasks.md`
- Backlog: `backlog.md`
- Bug tracking and quick action items

### `.planning/standards/` - Reference Materials
Reusable guidelines and checklists:
- Code review standards
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Development guidelines

**Do NOT create these files in the project root or src/ directory.**

See [.planning/README.md](.planning/README.md) for full details.

## Development Commands

### Setup and Build
- `npm install` - Install dependencies (required first step)
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript to JavaScript (outputs to `dist/`)
- `npm run dev` - Build and run in development mode
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

### Testing
⚠️ **Current State**: Test framework being developed
- `npm test` - Run test suite
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage report

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript** - Strict mode enabled (`tsconfig.json`)
- **ESLint** - Linting for code quality
- **Prettier** - Code formatting

### Pre-Commit Checklist
**Before committing and pushing code, ALWAYS run:**
```bash
npm run format        # Auto-fix formatting issues
npm run format:check  # Verify formatting is correct
npm run typecheck     # Check TypeScript types
npm run lint          # Check code quality
npm test              # Run all tests
```

**Why this matters:**
- CI will fail if formatting/linting/tests don't pass
- Running these locally saves time and prevents CI failures
- `npm run format` will automatically fix most formatting issues

## Git Commit Standards

### Commit Message Format
All commits must follow Conventional Commits format WITHOUT any AI attribution:

- **NEVER** append "code written by claude" or similar attribution to commit messages
- **NEVER** add signatures, author notes, or "written by" suffixes
- Use clean, professional commit messages focusing only on the changes

### Correct Format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Examples:
✅ CORRECT:
- `feat: add agent orchestration support`
- `fix: resolve workflow execution timeout`
- `docs: update deployment guide`
- `refactor: extract shared runtime utilities`

❌ INCORRECT:
- `feat: add API endpoints - code written by claude`
- `fix: bug fix (written by Claude)`
- Any commit with attribution or signatures

### Commit Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Architecture Overview

**Conductor** is an edge orchestration runtime for agent workflows. It runs on Cloudflare Workers and coordinates AI agents, tool execution, and workflow management across edge locations.

### Core Philosophy

1. **Edge-First Runtime**: Built for Cloudflare Workers edge infrastructure
2. **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinates multiple AI agents and their interactions
3. **Workflow Management**: Defines and executes complex agent workflows
4. **Tool Integration**: Connects agents to external tools and APIs

### Project Structure

├── wrangler.toml               # Cloudflare Workers configuration
└── package.json
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **Runtime Engine**
- Executes on Cloudflare Workers edge network
- Manages agent lifecycle and state
- Handles workflow orchestration

#### 2. **Agent System**
- Defines agent behaviors and capabilities
- Manages agent interactions and communication
- Integrates with AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

#### 3. **Workflow Engine**
- Defines multi-step agent workflows
- Handles branching, looping, and conditional logic
- Manages workflow state and persistence

#### 4. **Tool Integration**
- Connects agents to external APIs and services
- Provides standard tool interfaces
- Handles authentication and rate limiting

## Development Guidelines

### TypeScript Conventions

- **Strict mode enabled** - No implicit any, strict null checks
- **ES Modules** - Use `.js` extensions in imports (required for ESM)
- **Node types** - `@types/node` and `@cloudflare/workers-types` available
- **Explicit return types** - Preferred for public functions
- **Interface over type** - Use `interface` for object shapes

### Version Control

- Follow Conventional Commits strictly
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write commit messages in imperative mood
- No AI attribution in any git operations
- See [Git Commit Standards](#git-commit-standards) section for detailed requirements

## Release Process

### Official Changesets Workflow

This repository uses the **official** [changesets/action](https://github.com/changesets/action) for automated releases. This is the industry-standard approach used by thousands of open-source projects.

#### How to Release

**Step 1: Create a Changeset**
```bash
npx changeset add
```

You'll be prompted to:
- Select the bump type (patch/minor/major)
- Write a description of the changes

This creates a markdown file in `.changeset/` documenting your changes.

**Step 2: Commit and Push**
```bash
git add .changeset/
git commit -m "feat: add new feature X"
git push
```

**Step 3: Review the "Version Packages" PR** (created automatically)

GitHub Actions will create or update a PR titled **"Version Packages"** that:
- Shows all version bumps across packages
- Includes updated CHANGELOG.md
- Combines multiple changesets into one release
- Runs all tests/lint/build checks

**Step 4: Merge the PR When Ready**

When you merge the "Version Packages" PR, GitHub Actions automatically:
1. ✅ Publishes to npm
2. ✅ Creates GitHub release with CHANGELOG
3. ✅ Commits version bumps to master
4. ✅ Deletes consumed changesets

#### Complete Example

```bash
# Create changeset for a new feature
npx changeset add
# → Select: minor
# → Description: "Add email batch sending support"

# Commit and push
git add .changeset/
git commit -m "feat: add batch email sending"
git push

# GitHub Actions creates "Version Packages" PR
# → Review the PR
# → Merge when ready to release
# → npm publish happens automatically! 🎉
```

#### Benefits
- **Batched releases**: Multiple features/fixes released together
- **Manual control**: You decide when to release by merging the PR
- **No conflicts**: PR-based workflow handles all coordination
- **Audit trail**: PR shows exactly what's being released

### Deploying to Cloudflare Workers

```bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production

# Test locally with wrangler
npx wrangler dev
```

### Adding a New Agent

1. **Create agent definition** in `src/agents/`
2. **Register agent** with runtime
3. **Add tests** for agent behavior
4. **Update documentation**

### Adding a New Workflow

1. **Define workflow** in `src/workflows/`
2. **Configure workflow steps**
3. **Add error handling**
4. **Test workflow execution**
