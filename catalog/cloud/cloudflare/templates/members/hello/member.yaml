  Say hello to the user with a simple, deterministic greeting message.
  This is a basic function member that demonstrates the core Conductor workflow
  without requiring AI models or external services.

  The function implementation is in members/hello/index.ts and uses:
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Style-based greeting selection (formal, casual, friendly)
  - Shared utility functions from src/lib/
